    farmeramaDescription: 'The administrators of Farmerama, a small pig farm in Horsens, agreed on investing into a system which monitors the living conditions of the animals in terms of noise, temperature, humidity and CO2. The system consists of a client-server application with the client being the presentation tier, which takes care of the user experience within the system through an Android application. The server, responsible for handling the business logic and persisting data, consists of a web service implementation, a gateway application and a data warehouse. The IoT devices, that are running using FreeRTOS, are responsible for measuring data and sending it through the LoRaWAN network which the server then receives. The communication between the IoT devices and the server is bidirectional as the IoT devices also receive data in order to modify measurement thresholds and these instructions are sent all the way from the Android application through the server.',
    petbookDescription: "The system aims to reduce stray pet problems and provide a platform for pet lovers to connect. The profiles created for pets can be discovered by other users who are looking to adopt. The system uses a Three Tier architecture, with the user interface tier built using C# and the .NET framework with the Blazor framework and the Tailwind framework for UI creation. The tier responsible for business logic is made with C# and uses ASP.NET REST Web APIs to communicate with the user interface tier. The data storage tier is written in Java and uses Hibernate to access Postgresql databases, with sockets used for communication with the business logic tier. The system was developed using the Kanban methodology and follows the Unified Process framework. It also incorporates design patterns such as adapters and singletons to provide a flexible and efficient system. This system is designed to be distributed and heterogeneous, providing a seamless experience for users",
    mamboDescription: "This project aims to provide a platform for customers to order food from different restaurants with ease. With the app, people can get their food delivered without having to go to pick it up. The app serves two main user groups: restaurant owners and customers. The app is built for the Android operating system and was implemented using Java. The design of the app was done using XML. The user data is stored securely in Firebase, and users can log in using their Google account. The food data is sourced from an online API, and the data is manipulated to match the requirements of the app.",
    gatoDescription: "This project is a 2D platformer game showcasing a wide range of game development concepts. It involves scripting using MonoBehaviours, coroutines, and events for gameplay functionality. The implementation includes handling user input and manipulating vectors for smooth movement and controls. Physics elements like rigidbodies, colliders, and triggers are utilized for realistic interactions. Graphics and audio components, such as models, shaders, and audio clips, enhance the visual and auditory experience. Animation is incorporated through animators and animations for lifelike character movements. The game architecture follows best practices, utilizing game managers, ScriptableObjects, and adhering to SOLID principles. Game AI is implemented using finite-state machines, navmesh agents, and pathfinding algorithms for intelligent enemy behavior. User interface elements like menus and HUD provide a seamless and intuitive player experience.",
    simonGameDescription: "The Simon-Game project involves the implementation of a classic memory game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game requires players to follow a sequence of flashing colors and sounds in order to progress to higher levels. The game features a visually appealing and responsive user interface, built with HTML and CSS, and includes interactive elements powered by JavaScript. The project is aimed at creating an engaging and challenging experience for players, while also providing an opportunity to practice and enhance memory skills.",
