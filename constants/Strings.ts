    farmeramaDescription: 'The administrators of Farmerama, a small pig farm in Horsens, agreed on investing into a system which monitors the living conditions of the animals in terms of noise, temperature, humidity and CO2. The system consists of a client-server application with the client being the presentation tier, which takes care of the user experience within the system through an Android application. The server, responsible for handling the business logic and persisting data, consists of a web service implementation, a gateway application and a data warehouse. The IoT devices, that are running using FreeRTOS, are responsible for measuring data and sending it through the LoRaWAN network which the server then receives. The communication between the IoT devices and the server is bidirectional as the IoT devices also receive data in order to modify measurement thresholds and these instructions are sent all the way from the Android application through the server.',
